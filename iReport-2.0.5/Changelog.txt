24/03/2004 23:28 phenderson Enhanced I18n engine to load language properties files from the classpath.
                            All language files should now be on the classpath in package it/businesslogic/ireport/locale/
                            Language files should be named. Ireport_<language>.properties OR Ireport_<language>_<country>.properties
                            Where language is the 2 letter language name and country is the 2 letter country code.
                            (see the java doc on java.util.Locale for more info)
                            Also load ireport config first thing so the Look And Feel class can be set before any
                            GUI code is executed.
20/03/2004 22:53 phenderson ReportQueryDialog overhaul. I have radically improved the report query dialog, 
                            now the fields are read from the database automagically. Say bye bye to the read
                            fields, save query to report and clear list buttons, they were just confusing and
                            a source of problems. When the user hits ok, the fields of the report are replaced
                            with the currently selected fields, and the report query is also updated to match.
18/03/2004 08:49 ertano     BUG: #820943 fixed
18/03/2004 01:36 ertano     BUG: #915801 fixed (in Templates some elements had wrong height settings which caused problems)
16/03/2004 20:15 ertano     some updates for i18n; you can select a Language in OptionsDialog and save it now, 
			    available Languages will be read out of .\lang directory, I have added a Filter
			    so in an embedded environments we can differ between ireport language files and those from the main application
			    Language files must start with "Ireport" e.g. "Ireport_en_EN.properties"
16/03/2004 17:26 ertano     BUG #914744: Compatibility window close/ok event listeners implemented (save procedure still missing)
16/03/2004 17:13 ertano     BUG: iReport did not compile to default compilation directory fixed.
16/03/2004 11:44 phenderson More changes to the ant build script. We now produce
                            tar.gz versions with correct permissions on the shell 
                            script, for our *NIX users.
14/03/2004 23.55 gt78       Staring scriptlet support
14/03/2004 01.22 gt78       Added try and catch for setPLAF()
13/03/2004 23:55 ertano	    Started implementing I18n and Choosable L&F
11/03/2004 19:48 ertano     BUG #914149 fixed
11/03/2004 17:42 phenderson Trimmed the size of the source build by removing contrib/fonts/templats/examples
                            Removed misleading iReport.bat and iReport.sh as 
                            they are no good to end users, and a dev should 
                            have ant on the path anyway (you do dont you?)
                            
11/03/2004 17:13 phenderson Enhanced the ant build script again. 
                            I have added all the files from the release
                            version into cvs, and modified the ant build to
                            include these, when it build the distribution.
                            All releases should be made using...
                            ant dist
			    
10/03/2004 23.24 gt         Added support for property tag (new in jr 0.5.2)

06/03/2004 12.39 kku 	    Fixed a serius error on saving parameters

________________________________________________________________________________
Version 0.2.3 released
________________________________________________________________________________

28/02/2004 14:11 phenderson Enhanced the ant build script. We have a new target called dist which will
                            build 3 additional zip files, iReport_Full iReport_Lite and iReport_SRC
                            The only difference between Full and Lite is the inclusion of additional
                            3rd party JDBC libraries. The SRC version is the source code.
                            I've also placed the libraries needed to build iReport in CVS, currently
                            we are using JasperReports 0.5.2 iText1.02b
                            The database driver jar files are the up to date, as I just downloaded them.
                            My intention is that end users download iReport_Full, unzip, then just run it
                            using the provided bat file.                           

27/02/2004 20:38 phenderson The report query dialog can now read database fields even when the SQL statement 
                            has report parameters embeded within it. 
                            An example to illustrate.
                            SELECT * FROM t_quote WHERE id=$P{QuoteID} ORDER BY $P!{OrderBy}
                            This relies on the parameters having default values specified.
                            QuoteID java.lang.Integer default= new java.lang.Integer(1234)
                            OrderBy java.lang.String  default= "title ASC"

27/02/2004 17:54 ertano	    First steps to make iReport embeddable, MainFrame.openNewReportWindow made public
			    added new methods -> setEmbeddedIreport(boolean status), boolean isEmbedded()

23/02/2004 00.01 ertano     Fixed bug 843918

21/02/2004 08.24 brainjava  Added support to save the users preference of viewer.  See the MainFrame.java
                            file.  Nothing major, but nice none the less.
                            
21/02/2004 08.24 brainjava  Fixed a bug in the "do you want to save before closing" code.  If the user
                            clicked on the top right corner x in the window to close it would ask the
                            question and then it would hide the window and not exit.  Just found the
                            default close action was set to hide.  changed to do nothing.  Went ahead
                            and added for the window to dispose just in case of some internal OS memory
                            leaks when maybe a window handle isn't released correctly....(Windows I'm sure)

21/02/2004 08.24 brainjava  Fixed a bug where the Textfields were not being drawn correctly at design time.
                            The code was using a line measurer at one time, and someone had commented it out.
                            The code has to be there for the lines, space, and graphics to be drawn correctly
                            together.  The line measurer formats the graphics into paragraph style.  It also
                            deals with spacing and the alignment as in Mid, Top, Center, Left, etc.
                         
21/02/2004 08.24 brainjava  Changed the default directory for compiling.  Instead of the working directory
                            this has been modfied to use the users home directory. This seems safer than
                            compiling to a directory where a file named the same name as a temp file may
                            reside.  The user can still set the default directory.  The user can now
                            tell iReport to compile to the reports directory.  So for any given report
                            there will be the java file beside it in the directory when compiling is finished.
                            This is done with a check button on options panel.
                            
21/02/2004 08.24 brainjava  Disabled save buttons has been commented out.  This will be commented back
                            in after events to notify of expression changes has been added.  However,
                            the code to ask the user if they want to save before exiting still exists.
                            At the moment there is no code to ask on a per file basis as an internal
                            frame is closed.  This to come with the events.


20/02/2004 14:27 phenderson Added a server address field to the JDBC panel of the Report Connection dialog
                            this field is used with the wizard to generate the JDBC connection URL.
                            Also re-arranged the form a little bit to make things a bit simpler for the 
                            user. 
                            When the database driver is changed, automatically call the wizard to populate 
                            the JDBC URL field. in an attempt to help users.
                            Added Parents to the test connection dialogs.
                            BugFix: connection name was being used instead of the database name
                            BugFix: Now we close the database connection when testing

20/02/2004 08.45 brainjava  Added code to ask user as what to do about unsaved files on exit.  This code
                            shows and hides the Save and Save all info when things are saved and modified.
                            The only thing buggy I noticed is that everytime a report is opened a
                            ElementChange event is being called for the report.  So the report is being modified
                            when it is opened.  I assume this is not normal.  I didn't have time this go
                            round to do it.

20/02/2004 07.20 brainjava  Added method to Misc to get a Frame from any component.  This allowed me
                            to make the ValuesDialog the parent of any of it's children thus getting
                            rid of the peskie bug where only the v/p/f editing dialog would be displayed
                            if one had tabbed/moved off the application while working on a v/p/f.

20/02/2004 06.35 brainjava  Made some simple text changes.  Changed external editor error message say
                            launching instead of lunching.  Changed "Previous windpw" to "Previous window".

20/02/2004 05.20 brainjava  Added some static variables for file names which have been hard coded.

20/02/2004 01:20 brainjava  Added support for multi line expressions.  Simple to use go to options and check the box.
                            After box is checked then isCode attribute of all expressions will be set.  Using multi
                            line expressions means users must set the return with syntax value = correctValue; instead
                            of using no semi colon and using a mangled one liner statement.  I'm not sure how to work this
                            in, but I have updated Jasper Reports API and DTD.  (simple changes).  I have contacted
                            Teodor about the changes and I am working on getting them in the main branch.  The library is
                            posted as a jar file called brainjava_jasper.jar in the iReport2 repos.  Everyone should try it
                            out and let me know what they think about it.  It is pure java, and uses the system we currently
                            have.  This required some small changes to iReport.  Coders should be aware when creating a new
                            report object (at least in the time being) to set usingMultiLineExpressions on the report from 
                            the MainFrame classes usingMultiLineExpressions app option/property.
